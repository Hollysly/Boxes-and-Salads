# Boxes-and-Salads

In this paper, the number of possible ways to color the box under certain conditions will be discussed. This problem consists six parts in which two different types of coloring will be found for three different shapes of boxes, including code, square prism, and rect prism with 3 different face shapes. And boxes changing orientation with the same coloring does not count as a separate coloring. The process of finding the possible ways of coloring each box will be stated and justified.
Types of coloring:
1. There are six possible colors, and each face is a different color.
2. There are two colors —black and white—and each face is painted one of the colors.
Repeats are allowed, and all faces could be the same color.
